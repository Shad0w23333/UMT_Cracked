# UMT_Cracked (Universal Minecraft Tool)
## ⚠️DISCLAIMER ANYONE⚠️
WHO HAS SAID TO HAVE MADE A CRACK OF THE PROGRAM IS LYING THIS IS THE ONLY OFFICAL AND WORKING VERSION THAT IS NOT FAKE AND OPEN SOURCE
SnooPeanuts4040 Or IcyModz420 Aka XeIcyScopez HAS NOT HAD ANY WORK IN THIS PROJECT IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM
## I AM THE OFFICIAL DEVELOPER OF THIS PROJECT NO ONE ELSE HAS HELPED IN ANYWAY

## Overview

**UMT_Cracked** is a modified version of the Universal Minecraft Tool designed to allow access to the software without requiring a paid license.
The original application is not free to use, and this project was created to provide an alternative method for people who cannot afford the software or who simply want to test its functionality before purchasing.

This repository contains the required files and supporting components that allow the program to run without triggering license or account validation errors.

## How It Works

### 1. Authentication Bypass

* The `sign-in.php` file simulates a **successful login request** to the software.
* It returns a response that makes the application believe:

  * The account exists
  * The login credentials are valid
  * The software license is active
* This prevents login errors even when using **non-existent email/username and password combinations**.

### 2. Session Validation

* The `timeCheck.php` script loads data from the `timeCheckRes` file.
* This ensures:

  * No session expiration warnings
  * No invalid session popups
  * When attempting to convert, edit, or use the program’s features, it would not load correctly and would crash.

Without this component, the application would display **errors during authentication**.

### 3. Extension & Server Data

* The `extensionDoc` file is a **ZIP archive** containing a GitHub link used for:

  * Data verification
  * Server-side reference checks
  * This also contains the files, including images and other data for worlds players and tag editing images.
  * This file is **not strictly required** for functionality, but is included for completeness.

### 4. Logout Handling

* The `sign-out.php` file enables:

  * Proper logout behavior
  * No crashes or stuck sessions when exiting the account

---

## Chunk Loading & Conversion Fix

If the software is launched without modification USING the custom ui/overlay then the:

* **Chunks will not load**
* **World conversion will fail**
* **Editor and pruning tools will not function**

This happens because the original program depends on:

`
Data from the official server or domain name is handled by updateActivityLog.php and timeCheck.php
`

which checks for the presence and validity of:

`
UMT_STREAM_ENDED and its AES encryption/decryption mechanisms, along with block processing and several additional components that were added to the system.
`

### So It Was Decided

To restore full functionality, so an additional program e.g software is required. When using the UI overlay in this custom program, the following factors are taken into account:

* A **compatibility layer** is added on top of the cracked software.
* This secondary layer:

  * Loads chunk data normally
  * Enables world conversion between platforms
  * Restores editor and pruning features
  * Mimics the behavior of the original licensed environment

From the application’s perspective, everything appears **fully legitimate and operational**.

---

## Version Handling

* The `version.php` file is **required for any future UMT_Cracked fixes**.
* It only exists so the software:

  * Reports the expected version number
  * Avoids update or mismatch warnings

### ⚠️TAKE NOTE:
> The mobs in mob spawners are removed during conversion to prevent save failures and potential world crashes.
> 
> Converting Console worlds to Java/Bedrock works without any issues. **June 23 2026 1:42 PM — Fully Fixed July 4th 2026 11:43 PM**
>
> Converting Java/Bedrock worlds to Console Edition currently works only for TU73–TU75 (TU68 not yet supported). All mobs, items, and blocks are preserved 1:1 with TU75. Anything from newer Java versions or modded content is removed (blocks replaced with air, mobs/items deleted). The sky limit is changed to 256 for compatibility. Works without issues.
>
>In comparison, the official UMT software removes mobs and some items during Console To Console conversions, while my version fully preserves this data. For Java To Console conversions, it removes almost every single mob (leaving only about 5-10), does the same with most items, changes some items to older versions, removes or messes up some blocks, and deletes some water blocks. In contrast, my version preserves this data for Java To Console worlds as well.
>
> For Java/Bedrock conversions and when downgrading to older versions, I am using Chunker. It is faster and easier to work with, so please keep this in mind.
